# contribute to gh-contribute

This extension was originally designed to be lightweight and show off `gh`'s new extensions support. It's open to improvements towards being a more featureful tool and pull requests are encouraged.

Feel free to open issues with questions or feature requests. Feel free to open pull requests directly.

@vilmibm 's `gh` extensions are maintained in their spare time at work, so expect delays in reviews and responses.
